# **About**
This simple plugin adds several actions to Structure View context menu. 
They allow copy/cut/paste methods for several languages and IDE types.

# **Supported IDE**
I've tested it on Idea 2021 - 2022 for Java, XML, Json
Only Rider 2022 has Psi support for C++, so need to use that version for C# and C++

# **How to use**
* Install
* Open Structure view (View -> Tool windows -> Structure)
* Right click by any method in that view
* New actions will appear at the bottom
